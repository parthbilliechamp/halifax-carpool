# Abstract

With fuel prices steadily rising along with the burden of fossil fuels on our environment, we are moving towards more economical options of transportation. Personal travel has public transport and carpooling as options towards this goal. For now, ride sharing remains personal and non-centralized. To achieve a more widespread approach for ride sharing, I implemented a ride sharing web application which incentivizes drivers to take popular routes on their way.
The issue of rides not aligning with your travel plans has been observed with ride sharing. We aim to solve that by recommending users to hail multiple rides that can help them reach their destinations. Furthermore, I have implemented certain administrative features such as driver dashboards, hotspots in the city and more to inculcate an iterative and experimentative progress of the application.
