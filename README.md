# Halifax Ride Sharing Application

## An innovative Java Spring Boot web application that efficiently recommends rides to the users seeking transportation and connects riders with potential passengers. I have built my own optimized ride matching algorithm using advanced data structures like Graph theory and Dynamic Programming to match rides efficiently.

# Introduction & Goals


**Main goals:**
The main goal of this project is to create a web application that provides efficient ride recommendations to users in need of transportation and connects riders with potential passengers using a ride matching algorithm. This solution encourages carpooling among users, which, in turn, contributes to environmental protection by reducing carbon emissions.


# Tools

  - [Java with SpringBoot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
   
  - [React JS](https://react.dev/)
    - For developing the front end of the application

  - [Gitlab Runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/)
    - For configuring the CI/CD pipeline
      
  - [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
    - IDE for development

  - [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
    - Deployment of the application

# Ride matching Algorithm

- The ride matching algorithm developed for this application is explained in detail in section 4.2 of the [project document](#project-document)
